                                    linked to the Khanteum App (web) during the transaction of the final round of
                                    ‘Khanhwang’s Eggs’ in the tricolor format, the holder of the final round of

                                    procedure within two months.

                                <p>※ The software copyright of the Khanteum App Service is currently not registered by

                                    the Supreme Court of Korea, the copyright arises from the time it is announced to
                                    the public, so even if the copyright is registered after the announcement date, the
                                    system can be treated as a product subject to forward transaction under the
                                    Copyright Act, which recognizes the date of the first announcement of the copyright
                                    as the time when the copyright arises, in the case of the Khanteum App Service,
                                    which has been implemented in Korea since 2019.
