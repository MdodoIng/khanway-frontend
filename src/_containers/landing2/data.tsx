    desc: "While NFTs focus on being unique digital assets, NFWs add an additional dimension by incorporating the concept of warrants. NFWs, powered by software copyright, offer a membership to a specific goodwill and utilize a new economic theory called PROSUMELLER (Producer+Consumer+Reseller).   ",

  {
    id: 3,
    heading: "What role does the warrant play in NFW?",
    desc: "NFWs emphasize the inclusion of warrants, a function present in NFTs but rarely utilized. The warrant aspect is based on software copyright, and owning NFWs grants membership to a particular goodwill, introducing a unique profit structure backed by patents and copyrights owned by Khanaires Ltd., the founder of which is based in South Korea.",

    id: 4,
    heading: "How is the profit structure of NFW unique?",

    desc: "NFWs are traded online, but uniquely, only through national fiat currencies rather than cryptocurrencies. This decision is influenced by taxation considerations and the prevention of anti-money laundering. The digital assets are traded in a centralized format, with taxes such as 'other income taxes' for royalties and VAT for sales of software copyright memberships being paid.",

    heading: "What is the new market concept introduced by NFWs?",
    desc: "The new market concept is termed 'SEMI-DEFI' standing for Semi-Decentralized Finance. While NFTs are associated with the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, NFWs introduce the concept of SEMI-DEFI, combining centralized payment systems and decentralized features. This innovative market concept has been implemented in leading G20 countries like Korea, Dubai and India and we are planning to open in many other countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan etc.",

    heading: "How has Khanaires Korea set an example in the market?",
    desc: "Khanaires Korea, the entity behind NFWs, has been paying taxes, including other income taxes and VAT, for the past five years. This exemplifies a centralized payment system, setting a precedent in a leading G20 country and contributing to the development of the SEMI-DEFI market.",
