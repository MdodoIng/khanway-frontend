                                <p>Khanway does not support auction transactions for all NFW transactions. For example,
                                        the first transaction of "KhanHwang's Egg Reward Option NFW" issued and
                                        distributed within Khanway for the first time (hereinafter referred to as "NFW
                                        First Transaction") is a conditional limit price transaction, which is
                                        determined and guided by the vote of other companies and Members. However, as
                                        the global cryptocurrency market matures or the needs of members and companies
                                        change, auction transactions may be adopted, which will be determined by a vote
                                        of all Khanway community members.</p>
                                <p>Members must fully understand each sales method described when participating in the
                                        NFW First Transaction and participate in the Transaction. The Company may
                                        restrict the cancellation of bids in the NFW First Transaction to prevent false
                                        bids for the purpose of price manipulation.</p>
